    </div>

    <!-- Unrestricted Publicly Traded Securities -->
    <div class="give-section">
      <h4><span class="give-icon">üìà</span>Unrestricted Publicly Traded Securities</h4>
      <p>Donors give appreciated stocks, bonds, or mutual funds that are freely tradeable. The university sells them upon receipt and uses the proceeds.</p>
      <strong>Key Benefits to donors:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid capital gains tax</li>
        <li>Fair market value deduction</li>
        <li>Supports immediate needs</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Life Insurance -->
    <div class="give-section">
      <h4><span class="give-icon">üõ°</span>Life Insurance</h4>
      <p>A gift of life insurance involves donating an existing policy, purchasing a new one with the university as the beneficiary, or naming the university as a partial or full beneficiary of an existing policy. This planned giving vehicle allows donors to make a substantial future gift at a relatively low cost today.</p>
      <strong>Key Benefits to donors:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Leverage smaller contributions into a major gift</li>
        <li>Immediate tax benefits</li>
        <li>Reduce estate tax</li>
        <li>Retain financial flexibility</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Qualified Retirement Assets -->
    <div class="give-section">
      <h4><span class="give-icon">üîí</span>Qualified Retirement Assets</h4>
      <p>A gift of qualified retirement assets involves naming the university as a beneficiary (primary, secondary, or contingent) of an individual‚Äôs retirement account. These gifts pass outside the will, making them simple to implement and efficient for both the donor and the university.</p>
      <p>Donors can designate the university as a beneficiary of all or part of their tax-deferred retirement accounts (e.g., IRAs, 401(k)s, 403(b)s), creating a meaningful future impact while reducing the tax burden on heirs.</p>
      <strong>Key Benefits to donors:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Tax efficiency</li>
        <li>No legal fees required</li>
        <li>Flexible & recoverable</li>
        <li>Supports future impact</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Bequest or Devise -->
    <div class="give-section">
      <h4><span class="give-icon">üìù</span>Bequest or Devise</h4>
      <p>A bequest (or devise, in the case of real estate) is the most traditional and widely used form of planned giving. It refers to a gift made through a donor‚Äôs will or living trust, designating a portion of their estate to the university.</p>
      <p>Bequests allow individuals to create a lasting legacy without affecting their current financial situation.</p>
      <strong>Key Benefits to the donor:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Retain lifetime control</li>
        <li>No immediate out-of-pocket cost</li>
        <li>Estate tax advantages</li>
        <li>Flexible and simple</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Charitable Trusts -->
    <div class="give-section">
      <h4><span class="give-icon">üìú</span>Charitable Trusts</h4>
      <p>Charitable trusts are sophisticated planned giving vehicles that allow donors to contribute assets to a trust that benefits both charitable and non-charitable beneficiaries. They are often used to balance philanthropic goals with personal financial planning, such as generating lifetime income or providing for heirs.</p>
      <p>In the university context, charitable trusts offer powerful opportunities for legacy giving while delivering income, tax benefits, and long-term support for education, research, and scholarships.</p>
      <strong>Key Benefits to the donor:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Customizable</li>
        <li>Assets flexibility</li>
        <li>Professional management</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Donor Advised Funds and Private Foundation -->
    <div class="give-section">
      <h4><span class="give-icon">üèõ</span>Donor Advised Funds and Private Foundation</h4>
      <p>A Donor-Advised Fund (DAF) is a philanthropic vehicle established at a public charity that allows donors to make a charitable contribution, receive an immediate tax deduction, and then recommend grants over time to qualified nonprofit organizations.</p>
      <p>In the context of planned giving to universities, DAFs enable alumni and supporters to contribute assets (such as cash, securities, or other investments) to a DAF, and later direct distributions ("grants") from that fund to the university‚Äôs programs, scholarships, capital projects, or endowments.</p>
      <strong>Key Benefits to the donor:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Immediate tax deductions</li>
        <li>Flexibility in grant making</li>
        <li>Anonymity option</li>
        <li>Professional management</li>
        <li>Strategic philanthropy</li>
      </ul>
